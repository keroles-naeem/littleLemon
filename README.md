Technologies Used

1. Python

The primary programming language for developing the backend of the application. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for web development.
2. Django

A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django provides a robust set of features, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), authentication, and an admin interface, which simplifies the development process.
3. Django REST Framework (DRF)

A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. DRF allows for the creation of RESTful APIs, enabling the application to handle requests and responses in a structured manner. It supports serialization, authentication, and view sets, making it easier to develop and maintain APIs.
4. MySQL

A relational database management system used to store and manage the application's data. MySQL is known for its reliability and performance, making it a popular choice for web applications.
5. Git

A version control system that tracks changes in the codebase. Git allows for collaboration among developers and helps manage different versions of the project. It is essential for maintaining a history of changes and facilitating teamwork.
6. GitHub

A platform for hosting Git repositories. GitHub provides a collaborative environment for developers to share code, track issues, and manage project documentation. It also allows for pull requests and code reviews, enhancing the development workflow.
7. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

A source-code editor that provides support for debugging, syntax highlighting, and version control. VS Code is highly customizable and offers a wide range of extensions, making it a popular choice among developers.
8. Insomnia

A powerful REST client used for testing APIs. Insomnia allows developers to send requests to the API endpoints and view responses, making it easier to debug and ensure the API functions as expected.
9. Djoser

A Django app that provides a set of views to handle user authentication. Djoser simplifies the process of implementing user registration, login, and token authentication, enhancing the security of the application.
10. HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Technologies used for creating the front-end of the application. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing for a seamless user experience.
11. Unit Testing Framework

Djangoâ€™s built-in testing framework is used to write unit tests for the application. This ensures that the code is functioning as intended and helps catch bugs early in the development process.
